### Readme

This is a learning project to help me learn c++. What this app will do is assist
in creating a character using the Basic Fantasy rules.

The ultimate goal of this project is to save the created character to file and 
to also print out a character sheet with all the information filled in.

I am just starting to learn C++ so this may be a very long project for me and 
I know it will go through many refactoring as I learn to do things better.
